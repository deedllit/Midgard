	 * In this constructor we first add the slot for our showcase item to go in.
	 * When we add a slot, it first takes in the inventory that we add it to, then
	 * the index of the slot. Then it takes the left and top positions of the slot.
	 * 
	 * We then do this for the main inventory but instead we loop through the 3 rows
	 * and 9 columns. We add this slot to the player inventory, with an index of 9 +
	 * (row * 9) + column. The reason we do that is because it has to be greater
	 * than 9, as 0 - 9 is the hotbar. Then we do row multiplied by 9, so this knows
	 * to increase by another 9 for each row that it goes down. Finally we add the
	 * column so that we can do how far along the row we are. Then the x position is
	 * the starting X position of the first slot in the inventory, plus the number
	 * of the column that we are in multiplied slotSizePlus2(18) so that we know how
	 * many pixels there are between slots. For the Y position, it is the same, but
	 * with rows instead of columns.
	 * 
	 * Then we do the same for the hotbar except we only need 1 for loop, and thats
	 * for the 9 columns. We don't need a loop for the rows as there is only the 1
	 * row. We once again add a slot in the player's inventory with an index of the
	 * column. The X position that we set it so is the starting X position of the
	 * first slot in the hotbar plus slotSizePlus2(18 - which is the number of
	 * pixels between slots), multiplied by the column that we are currently in.
	 * Then we can just hardcode the Y position as 142 as that doesn't change in the
	 * hotbar.
